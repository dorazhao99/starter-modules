## SYMSYS 195L: Methods in Psycholinguistics (LINGUIST 245B)
This course introduces students to psycholinguistic methods and techniques, including experimental design and data analysis. Through a project-based approach, students will gain hands-on experience designing and running their own experiments, managing and analyzing data, and using open science tools.
This course has the potential to be highly rewarding, but it requires a lot of effort and self-initiative, particularly in learning programming languages and statistical methods. When taught by Judith Degen, the course receives glowing reviews, but with other instructors, such as Margaret, the experience can be negative due to lack of support and guidance. Overall, the course is a great opportunity to learn experimental methods and gain hands-on experience with coding and data analysis, but students should be prepared to dedicate significant time and effort to succeed.
