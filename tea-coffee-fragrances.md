## Tea
- Wulong Cha from Nishane - ["a fresh green tea that last. Someday, it is the most realistic sencha to my nose - tender green and gentle tannin. Sometimes it's green apple boba tea with a bit too much grass jelly and not enough ice.", "it leans more true green tea than matcha or matcha powder but nonetheless it’s the best citrus green tea imo.", " A citrus tea with really great longevity - This one (rightly) gets compared to a high-end spa on here a lot. Very well-balanced mix of green/citrus/fruit/woods. I wish I could pick up tea a bit more, but I love the way the fruitiness (litchi & fig) gives sweetness without ever getting cloying. I tried it in colder weather a couple years ago and it felt too sharp, but I have been loving it this summer.", " is dear polly’s more citrus-heavy, tropical cousin! some folks aren’t a fan of it, though, but i personally quite like it. black tea, orange, lychee, and a mild figgy vibe. not as sweet as dear polly, and the next fragrance, either.", "very green tea to me and great in hot weather but a little too sharp and sour on my skin. I have a decant, wouldn’t buy a bottle."]  
- Le Labo Thé Noir 29 - black tea, fig, tobacco, vetiver
- Mixed emotions from byredo ["was a really nice surprise for me! huge fan of it and will eventually be getting a bottle - it smells a lot like you made a cup of tea and cracked open a bottle of currant jam for your morning toast. really, really pleasant, and super wearable."]
- Vilhelm Dear Polly - ["warm black tea", "This is a favorite on this sub for good reason. Lightly fruity black tea with lots of green notes and the kind of sheer woods reminiscent of BR 540. It smells lovely year round.", "she’s green and bergamot heavy, with a lovely fresh crisp green apple that lasts for a lot longer than you’d expect, paired with a black tea note. super lovely, one of my favorites."]
- Parfums di Nicolai Fig Tea ["Don't be fooled by the name, there's no fig here that I can detect, but it is a glorious apricot-heavy osmanthus tea. Juicier than Osmanthe Yunnan."] 
- Jovoy Remember Me - chai latte
- By Kilian Princess - fruity green tea and marshmallows
- Memo Winter Palace - ["red tea, overall scent is quite weak though", "I really can’t detect the tea in this sadly. It’s a heavy warm, slightly powdery Amber with some vanilla and orange. Unfortunately I can’t stand amber, or warm, heavy, powdery fragrances, and I don’t particularly like vanilla or orange either, so this is a strong no for me."] 
- BDK Gris Charnel - cardamom, fig, black tea, sandalwood
- JLo Still - ["earl grey tea and white florals", " Got this (ugly lol) bottle for cheap because I remembered thinking it was suprisingly nice in high school, and it really holds up. Lovely florals, sparkling Earl Grey tea, and shower-fresh musks."] 
- Lutens Five O Clock Au Gingembre - spicy chai/black tea; ginger tea with honey over an amber base. I get the patchouli too, which is why it's not in my favorites (patchouli somehow makes things go too masculine on me), but it would be beautiful on someone else.
- Berdoues Assam of India - ["black tea with a slice of lemon", "I think you might really like it. A very photorealistic lemon tea - think Wulong Cha but black tea. Doesn’t last that long but well priced so I don’t mind."]
- L'Artisan Tea for Two - ["smoky, spicy black tea", " can see why people like this. Strong black tea, with a touch of sweetness, touch of lightness, and a strong smokiness. Sadly smoke just doesn’t work on me, but I appreciate what it’s doing."] 
- Mona di Orio Bohea Boheme - like a hot toddy, rich and slightly boozy
- Mona di Orio Eau Absolue - lemon honey tea
- Fragonard Jasmin Perle de The - jasmine green tea
- Fantome Kensington - earl grey with lemon and milk, maybe some scone crumbsv(I can only vouch for the oil, haven't tried the EDP)
- 4160 Tuesdays Tea & Biscuits - exactly true to notes
- J-Scent Roasted Green Tea - ["the most realistic matcha scent I've tried, slapped me with matcha. It’s the only time I’ve ever smelled overt green tea in a fragrance.", "as a very initial green matcha scent. So much so that I couldn’t wear it because all I wanted was to eat matcha."] 
- Elizabeth Arden Green Tea. ["Such a simple yet beautifully fresh green tea scent. Bought it for my wife & she fell in love with it.", "Got this enormous bottle for a steal so I can hardly complain, but it makes me think of cleaning products at the opening. The citrus is bracing and definitely refreshing on a swampy day."
- Kilian - Imperial Tea
- Jo Malone's Midnight Black Tea
- Maison Margiela Matcha Meditation ["I'm liking it quite a lot actually! The opening feels like a very realistic matcha scent with a slight citrus that fades quite quickly. The matcha is then joined by a prominent jasmine note. I could see someone who doesn't like white florals feel like the jasmine overpowers the whole fragrance, but there is a matcha bitterness that remains that brings it into tea territory for me. I love jasmine so this isn't a problem for me, but it could ruin it for someone looking strictly for matcha. In the dry down, this gets sweeter and milkier, moving it into a matcha/jasmine tea latte vibe imo. The notes include white chocolate which I think is what contributes to this sweet latte scent, but I personally never detect anything explicitly chocolate.". "if you're into Green/Sweet/Gourmand: this is my fav and almost signature because I love it so much. Has bitter green tea perfectly balanced with sweet white chocolate that dries down to sophisticated vanilla while the bitterness of green tea still projects to end.", "The white chocolate in here is powerful and makes this more of a cool weather fragrance. Too gourmand to suit my summer needs!", "spot-on matcha latte. creamy, lactonic, and the slightest bit grassy. it really does smell like you made yourself a matcha shake or something. love it."]
- Hermes Osmanthe Yunnan - I just wish this one had more OOMPH, ya know? But I guess that's what you get with Jean Claude Ellena's watercolor style. It is a beautiful, milky osmanthus with just a wisp of smoke. 
- Arielle shoshana sunday "It smells like the inside of a boba tea shop to me, which sounds good on paper but sadly was a little too cloyingly sweet for my nose."
- Cabanel Je Ne Sais Quois- it’s matcha/mate with a lot of rice- it’s very unique smelling like you opened a bag filled with the powdery smells of dry rice and green tea. Then it has a bit of sweetness.
- Le Labo Match 26
- Armani Prive The Yulong ["This is an unquestionably pretty citrus green tea, but not worth the Prive price tag."]
- Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Teazzurra -["Soft and beautiful, I almost swooned when I first sniffed my sample. This is my favorite floral green tea frag of the bunch. Perfect balance of sweet/floral/citrus/woody to give a realist jasmine boba tea impression. The ambery heart is slightly milky but never becomes cloying.  More refreshing than some of the other more gourmand tea frags I've tried. Never would've thought I could fall so hard for a fragrance with calone!"]
- o unknown, from imaginary authors, is a creamy tea latte with a kind of musky, powdery drydown. that said…a lot of folks think it smells like playdoh, so proceed with caution. i just wasn’t personally a huge fan of this one, but i know folks who adore it!

bianca, from tocca, is a very much more feminine green tea scent, with a bit of rose and lavender and a lot of citrus. there’s not a whole lot happening, but it’s really easy to like!

sci fi, from ellis brooklyn, ["is another really good tea fragrance. citrus again, but this time it’s more bitter orange than lemon or bergamot, and a kind of creamy vanilla drydown. super gender neutral, imo, it doesn’t lean much one way or another.", "such a cool name, such a disappointing scent. Bug spray mixed with generic fruity floral perfume smell. No discernible tea."]
