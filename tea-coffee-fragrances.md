## If you want to smell like tea
- Wulong Cha from Nishane
- Le Labo Th√© Noir 29 - black tea, fig, tobacco, vetiver
- Vilhelm Dear Polly - warm black tea
- Jovoy Remember Me - chai latte
- By Kilian Princess - fruity green tea and marshmallows
- Memo Winter Palace - red tea, overall scent is quite weak though
- BDK Gris Charnel - cardamom, fig, black tea, sandalwood
- JLo Still - earl grey tea and white florals
- Lutens Five O Clock Au Gingembre - spicy chai/black tea; ginger tea with honey over an amber base. I get the patchouli too, which is why it's not in my favorites (patchouli somehow makes things go too masculine on me), but it would be beautiful on someone else.
- Berdoues Assam of India - black tea with a slice of lemon
- L'Artisan Tea for Two - smoky, spicy black tea
- Mona di Orio Bohea Boheme - like a hot toddy, rich and slightly boozy
- Mona di Orio Eau Absolue - lemon honey tea
- Fragonard Jasmin Perle de The - jasmine green tea
- Fantome Kensington - earl grey with lemon and milk, maybe some scone crumbsv(I can only vouch for the oil, haven't tried the EDP)
- 4160 Tuesdays Tea & Biscuits - exactly true to notes
- J-Scent Roasted Green Tea - the most realistic matcha scent I've tried
