## IIS 199: Interschool Honors Program in International Security Studies
This year-long seminar brings together students from various academic departments to explore and research international security through discussions, analyses, and presentations. Students will develop research methods, evaluate policies, and produce an honors thesis as a culmination of their work.
The CISAC Honors Program is a challenging but rewarding experience that allows students to conduct original research and develop expertise on a topic of interest. Students praise the program's supportive teaching team, cohort, and advisors, but note that it requires a significant time commitment and dedication. Overall, the program is highly recommended for students interested in research, policy, and academics, but students should be aware of the demands and plan accordingly.
