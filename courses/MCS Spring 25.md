 ## MCS 120: Data Narratives (DATASCI 120)
This course focuses on developing the ability to communicate data-driven insights and ideas through effective narratives, exploring essential elements of data inquiry and communication. Students will apply these concepts to a self-identified dataset and question, culminating in a final paper that showcases their ability to analyze and present data in a clear and compelling manner.
This course is highly recommended, especially for those looking to become proficient in R, with a flexible format that allows exploration of various interests. The instructors and TAs, such as Ben and Chiara, provide excellent support, but prior experience with statistical methods is suggested to aid in analysis. Overall, the course is well-taught and a great option, with tips to find a topic and dataset early and not hesitate to ask for help.
