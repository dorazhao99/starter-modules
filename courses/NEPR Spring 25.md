## NEPR 280: Neuroscience Journal Club and Professional Development Series
This course requires Neurosciences Ph.D. students to participate in a journal club and professional development series, where they present and discuss recent papers in neuroscience literature. The series runs throughout the first three years of study, during the Autumn, Winter, and Spring quarters.
This course is great for students who want to gain exposure to different fields of neuroscience and improve their presentation skills, with many praising the opportunity to learn from peers and practice communicating scientific research. However, some students found the workload and mandatory professional development sessions to be more than expected, and the penalty for missing a class or deadline to be harsh. Overall, the course is a valuable way to engage with the neuroscience community and learn about recent advancements in the field.
