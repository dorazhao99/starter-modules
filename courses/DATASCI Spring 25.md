## DATASCI 120: Data Narratives (MCS 120)
This course focuses on developing students' ability to effectively communicate data-driven insights and ideas through a well-crafted narrative, covering essential elements of data inquiry and communication. Students will apply these concepts by analyzing and writing about a self-identified dataset and research question, culminating in a final paper that showcases their findings.
This course is highly recommended, especially for those looking to become proficient in R, with a flexible format that allows exploration of various interests. The instructors and TAs, such as Ben and Chiara, provide excellent support, but having prior knowledge of statistical methods is helpful. Students are advised to choose a topic and dataset early and not hesitate to ask for help to get the most out of the course.
