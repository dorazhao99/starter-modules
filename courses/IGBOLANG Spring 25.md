# Igbo (IGBOLANG) Courses Spring 25 
Courses in the IGBOLANG Department offered this spring at Stanford
 ## IGBOLANG 3: First-Year Igbo, Third Quarter
This course is a continuation of IGBOLANG 2 and is available to students who have completed the prerequisite course. It also fulfills the University's Foreign Language requirement.
The course is relatively easy to pass, but its value is questionable. It may not be suitable for those without prior knowledge of the Igbo language. However, for those who already understand Igbo, the course can be a good opportunity to practice writing and reading comprehension.
