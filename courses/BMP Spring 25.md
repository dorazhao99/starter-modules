# Biomedical Physics (BMP) Courses Spring 25 
Courses in the BMP Department offered this spring at Stanford
 ## BMP 210B: Clinical Seminar Series for Biomedical Physics (RAD 210B)
This seminar series explores the applications of biomedical physics in clinical radiology and radiation oncology, covering topics such as imaging methods and disease detection. The course features speakers from Stanford Clinicians, providing an overview of the translation of technical research to clinical practice.
## BMP 226: MRI Spin Physics, Relaxation Theory, and Contrast Mechanisms (BIOE 226, RAD 226)
This course covers the fundamental principles of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS), focusing on the analytical tools needed to understand nuclear spin interactions and image contrast. It explores topics from quantum mechanics to NMR relaxation theory, providing a foundation for analyzing MRI contrast mechanisms and agents.
This course is highly recommended for those interested in MRI research, with organized material and helpful instructors, but requires a strong math background and familiarity with NMR techniques. The workload can be intense, but students who are dedicated and interested in the subject can learn a great deal. It's suggested that quantum mechanics be a prerequisite, and students should be prepared to invest time and effort to fully appreciate the course's rich material.
