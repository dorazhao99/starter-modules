# Linguistics (LINGUIST) Courses Spring 25 
Courses in the LINGUIST Department offered this spring at Stanford
 ## LINGUIST 35: Minds and Machines (CS 24, PHIL 99, PSYCH 35, SYMSYS 1, SYMSYS 200)
This course provides an interdisciplinary introduction to the study of cognition, information, and language, exploring foundational issues in minds, computation, and intelligence. It covers the methods of philosophy, mathematics, research, and computational modeling used to study human and artificial intelligence, and is a required foundation for the Symbolic Systems major.
This course provides a broad overview of symbolic systems, covering various topics and disciplines, but its flipped classroom format and asynchronous structure can be frustrating and disengaging for some students. While many students find the course interesting and a great introduction to the major, others feel that it lacks depth and coherence, with too much busywork and not enough meaningful learning. Overall, the course is considered easy, but its effectiveness depends on the student's ability to self-motivate and engage with the material.
