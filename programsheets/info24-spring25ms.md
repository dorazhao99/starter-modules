## Details 
|  Key | Value|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Description | Requirements for Master's students majoring in CS at Stanford on the IMA track |

Students can use any program sheet starting the year they matriculated into Stanford. This sheet is valid for any student matriculating in 2024-2025. 

## Requirements
### Foundations Requirement

- Logic, Automata & Complexity (CS 103)
- Probability (CS 109, STATS 116, CME 106, MS&E 220, EE 178)
- Algorithmic Analysis (CS 161)
- Computer Organization & Systems (CS 107 or 107E)
- Principles of Computer Systems (CS 111)
  
### Significant Implementation Requirement
*At least one course in your MS program should be designated as satisfying the Significant Implementation Requirement. Note that this course will also be used to satisfy some other requirement (i.e., Depth, or Elective). Must be taken for a letter grade, must be taken at Stanford. Coterm students who took two of these courses at Stanford as undergraduates may waive this requirement. Deviations must be approved by the faculty director of the MS program, Cynthia Lee.*

Courses that may be used to satisfy the significant implementation requirement: CS 140E, 143, 144, 145, 148, 151, 190, 210B, 212 (or 112 or 140), 224R, 227B, 231N, 239, 243, 248A, 248B, 251, and 330. 

### Breadth Requirement
Three courses, with each course chosen from a different Breadth area A, B, C or D. Breadth courses may not be waived, must be taken for at least 3 units each, and must be completed for a letter grade.* Each of the three Breadth courses must be from different Areas. Note that these courses will also be used to satisfy some other requirement (i.e., Depth or Elective).
