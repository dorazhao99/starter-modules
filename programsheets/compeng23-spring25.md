Students will complete a research project, submit a paper or presentation, and deliver a public presentation of their results. Hours spent: None Average Rating: nan 1-6 units 
### CS 191W: Writing Intensive Senior Research Project
-  is a writing-intensive version of CS191, restricted to Computer Science students, and requires a project proposal and instructor consent. Students must have completed at least 135 units and enroll in the section led by their research instructor. Hours spent: None Average Rating: nan 3-6 units 
### CS 194: Software Project
-  involves the design, development, and testing of a significant team programming project under faculty supervision, culminating in a public demonstration of the completed project. Students will also maintain detailed documentation of the project's progress, design, and performance, applying concepts learned in previous computer science courses.
-  offers a high degree of autonomy, allowing students to work on their own projects and ideas, but requires strong teamwork and organization to succeed. Many reviewers emphasized the importance of having a good team and clear communication to achieve a positive experience. Despite some criticisms of disorganization and lack of direction, the course is generally considered a valuable learning experience, particularly for those interested in collaborative software development.

### CS 194W: Software Project (WIM)
-  is a writing-intensive version of CS194, restricted to Computer Science and Electrical Engineering undergraduates, with preference given to seniors. It requires prerequisites of CS109 and CS161, and is designed to provide a more in-depth writing experience for students in their final year of study.
-  allows students to design and develop a software project with a small group, providing the opportunity to work with interesting people and create innovative products. While the class can be fun and chill, it requires a significant time commitment and organization, with some students finding the assignments and lectures to be disorganized and unclear. Overall, the course is a great learning experience, especially for those who take it as a chance to work on a project they're passionate about and develop hands-on skills in software engineering.
