### HCI Depth
All depth courses must be taken for a letter grade* for 3 or more units. Any deviations from the stated requirements must be noted and approved by your advisor in the Advisor Notes box provided (maximum of one advisor-approved deviation allowed). Courses taken for your Stanford undergraduate degree should be listed for 0 units. Enter course selection in the table below:

- All of: CS 147, 247 (any suffix), and 347. In addition, either 142 or 147L. All courses must be taken for 3+ units. Students who completed any of these courses  for a previous degree at Stanford have satisfied this requirement: select the course and change the units in the Course List to 0. Students who took an equivalent course at another institution can submit a waiver request on GIN. CS147 may only be waived if an equivalent course has previously been completed at another institution and approved via the waiver form on GIN.
- One of: CS 278, 448B. If one of these courses was taken for another Stanford degree, a different one must be taken for the MS; if both of these courses were taken for another Stanford degree, this requirement can be waived. Students who took an equivalent course at another institution can submit a waiver request on GIN.
- Two additional courses drawn from (b) and the following list: CS 177, 194H, 206, 210A, 224C, 247 (any suffix besides the course used for requirement (a)), 329X, 377 (any suffix and 3 or more units). Students who completed two of these courses for a previous degree at Stanford have satisfied this requirement: select the course and change the units in the Course List to 0. Students who took an equivalent course at another institution can submit a waiver request on GIN.
- A total of at least 21 units from categories (a), (b), (c) and the following: ArtStud 130, 163, 165A, 169A, 231A; Communication (Comm 224, 272, 324); Design (DESIGN 101, 121, 131, 151, 170); Empirical Methods (Comm 254, 314, Educ 200B, MS&E 125, Psych 251, 252, 253, Stats 203); Learning Design & Tech (CS 498C; Educ 281, 342, 432); Man Sci & Eng (MS&E184, 231, 334); Mech Eng (ME 203, 210); Music (Music 220A, 220B, 220C, 250A, 256A); Psych (Psych 204, 209); Sym Sys 245; courses listed at http://dschool.stanford.edu under 'elective classes' for 3 units or more and numbered 100 and above are also acceptable.
