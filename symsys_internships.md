## Computational theories of human visual abstraction
Contact: jefan@stanford.edu

Faculty Supervisor: Judith Fan

Short description: Understanding how humans use pictures, diagrams, and plots to learn & communicate

Project Abstract: Technologies for expressing ideas in visual form have been critically important throughout human history. From ancient cave paintings to modern digital graphics, such technologies lie at the heart of some of our most significant inventions, including art, writing, and mathematics. Despite the importance of such technologies, little is known about how the human mind is capable of using them in such varied ways. Perhaps the most basic and versatile of these technologies is drawing, which can be used to convey information about the visual world at many levels of abstraction, ranging from realistic illustrations to simplified diagrams. This project will harness large datasets and advanced data analysis techniques to develop a rigorous understanding of the mental processes involved when people use drawings to communicate visual concepts in different ways. Results from this project will advance our understanding of why people prefer to use certain kinds of images in some contexts and not others, with implications for how to design effective visualizations for a variety of applications, including STEM education and research.

Relevant Background and Experience:
In addition to strong motivation and scientific curiosity, the research we do in the lab requires a variety of technical and professional skills. Prospective lab members should have experience with several of the skills listed below, along with a positive attitude about and willingness to quickly/independently learn about others:

1. Working with data and statistical reasoning: Generally speaking, this means being able to think critically about how different kinds of data help to answer research questions. It also means being able to write code to wrangle, visualize, and analyze high-dimensional datasets from psychology and neuroscience experiments. In practice, you should be familiar with some combination of the major programming languages used for scientific computing: Python, R. Ideally, you will have exercised these skills in another research context, or have taken courses in statistics, data science, and/or machine learning.

2. Web programming for developing behavioral experiments: One of our primary tools for investigating human cognition and behavior is to conduct large-scale behavioral experiments, usually online and sometimes in field settings. In practice, you should be familiar with using JavaScript, HTML, CSS to build interactive web application frontends, and also with various backend server-side environments, such as Node.js.

3. Reproducible research workflows: Progress in science requires that we be able to reproduce our own and others’ research. In practice, you should be comfortable not only thoroughly documenting your own code, but adapting the code of others, writing READMEs when appropriate, and proactively anticipating how you will share your code and datasets so that other researchers can adapt and build on your work.

4. Communication and organization: Researchers must be able to clearly communicate the results of their work. Strong writing and oral presentation skills are critical. We are looking for students who are well organized, thoughtful, and proactive about their own research and training. Especially in collaborative projects, it is important to communicate with me and other collaborators throughout the research process: reporting progress, asking for help, etc. All lab members leading research projects are expected to proactively prepare clear meeting agendas, take detailed notes during meetings, and use other digital communication channels as needed to keep track of progress, next steps, and outstanding challenges.

5. Generosity towards others: Science is inherently a social enterprise. It is more likely that you will thrive in our lab if you are in the habit of acting not only in the interests of your own needs and desires, but also on behalf of others and the communities that you belong to. We are looking for individuals to join our team who are committed to co-existing with others with generosity, kindness, and compassion. In particular, we value demonstrations of leadership in promoting these qualities in other organizations you have been a part of.

Please email Prof. Fan at jefan@stanford.edu with any questions.

## Screenomics: How Moment-to-Moment Dynamics of Smartphone Use Relate to Emotions, Health, and Well-Being
Contact: agarron@stanford.edu

Faculty Supervisor: Nilam Ram

Short description: Smartphone Use Relation to Emotions, Health, and Well-Being	

Faculty mentor: Nilam Ram
Research supervisor(s):
A Garron Torres, Change Lab Manager, agarron@stanford.edu

The Change Lab @ Stanford (thechangelab.stanford.edu) studies change and attempts to
invoke change. We study how people change, how media change, how the world changes, and how all those changes interact and influence each other over time. We develop novel
techniques for measuring change (often using mobile technologies), cool data visualizations (and sonifications), and novel methods for analysis of longitudinal data. We occasionally forward new theories about the dynamics of human behavior and human interaction. Often, we are engaged in analyzing the large repositories of smartphone data collected in the Human Screenome Project (screenomics.stanford.edu) and using experience sampling data to study emotion regulation dynamics.

Undergraduate students are encouraged to contribute their own research interests and life
perspectives while developing advanced research projects alongside a fast-moving collective of graduate students, post-docs, and faculty working at the edges of the possible.

The Change Lab @ Stanford is committed to global diversity and fostering minority
representation in social and computational science. We collaborate widely across schools and departments at Stanford and work with many academic and industry partners across the world to create change.

Skills required:
- Prior research experience not required, but helpful
- Programming in R and/or Python
- Ability to work independently and as a part of the research team
- Analytical thinking
- Good organizational skills	

Skills to be learned:
- Building computational models of human behavior and comparing model predictions to human data
- Curation, visualization and analysis of longitudinal data
- Designing and conducting online research	
- Interactive visual and/or sonic displays


## Causal verbs and mental states
Contact: davdrose@stanford.edu

Faculty Supervisor: Ellen Markman

Short description: Developing an understanding of causal language and theory of mind

A fundamental way to reason about causation is in terms of direct contact, like billiard balls colliding. Although collision-like causes have played an important role in philosophical and psychological theories of causation, humans conceptualize many events that lack direct contact as causes. If Andy hits Suzy with his bike, Suzy falls into a fence and it breaks, Andy is a cause of the fence breaking. We also treat absences as causes. If Suzy forgets sunscreen and gets sunburned, the absence of sunscreen is a cause. Moreover, there are linguistic distinctions between verbs that refer to these: Andy “caused” the fence to break but Suzy “broke” it. The absence of sunscreen “caused” Suzy’s sunburn, but the sun “burned” it.  In previous work, we have argued that there is a deep connection between causal language and causal representations, and have explored how children develop a mapping between causal expressions and causal relations. We find that even though children rarely hear the word “cause”, by 4 they already map it to distal causes (like Andy, who is on the bike). At the same time the map verbs like “break” to proximal causes (like Suzy, who fell into the fence). Around 6, they also begin mapping “cause” to absences (like forgetting sunscreen). 

These situations we have so far explored all involve physical causation. It is less clear how thinking about direct contact and production might be useful in understanding how mental states are produced in others. For example, consider the following situation: Andy knows that Suzy doesn’t like celery but tells Bobby that Suzy does. At snack time, Bobby gives Suzy celery. As a result, Suzy is angry. This situation is different from cases of physical causation that involve billiard ball-like collisions (like Andy hitting Suzy with his bike, Suzy falling into the fence and the fence breaking). In this case, there is no chain of direct contact that can be traced from causes to effects. Still, in such a situation, it seems like it might be appropriate to say that Bobby angered Suzy and that Andy caused Suzy to be angry. 

This project is aimed at exploring how different causal verbs map to different kinds of causes in the mental domain and how that supports children's developing understanding of mental states. The kind of mental state verbs that we will focus on are those that include more emotion-like states, such as anger, and those that involve more cognitive-like states, like confusion. Our working hypothesis is that just like young children can distinguish different kinds of causes in physical situations—causal chains like Andy hitting Suzy with his bike, Suzy falling into the fence and the fence breaking, and map different causal verbs to these different relations—–so too they can distinguish kinds of causes with different verbs when confronted with more physical like mental states, such as emotions. So for a causal chain involving mental states—like Andy telling Bobby that Suzy likes celery when he knows she doesn't like it, Bobby giving it to Suzy, and Suzy becoming angry–children will map these causal verbs involving mental states to different kinds of causes, saying thing Bobby “angered” Suzy but that Andy “caused” Suzy to be angry.  We predict that later they will map casual verbs that are less physical-like, those involving more cognitive-like states like confusion, to different kinds of causes in causal chains. This would suggest that children bootstrap an understanding of physical causation to help them understand physical-like mental states such as emotions and then develop a more expansive conception that includes more cognitive states. Our findings will bear on issues in the development of theory of mind, causation, and relate to issues in linguistics and philosophy.

## Collective behavior in ant colonies
Contact: dmgordon@stanford.edu

Faculty Supervisor: Deborah M Gordon

Short description: Ecological and neuroscience studies of collective behavior in ants

Our lab examines how systems work without central control. We are looking for undergraduates to join a group of grad students and postdocs asking how interaction networks regulate the foraging behavior of ant colonies.  We are investigating the neural mechanisms for how an ant decides whether to leave the nest on its next foraging trip.  In the aggregate, these individual decisions determine how the colony manages the tradeoff between getting food and water loss to evaporation when foraging in the desert. Summer work on campus in the lab is investigating the role of dopamine neurophysiology in an ant's response to the brief olfactory that stimulate an ant to leave the nest on its next trip. This part of the project could involve both image analysis and simulations. For the last 3 weeks of August, we will be doing field work continuing a long-term study of foraging behavior in a population of seed-eating desert ants. Colonies live for 20-30 years, and the location and age of all colonies are known, so that we can study how colony behavior changes as the colony grows older and larger. We will stay at the Southwest Research Station in the Chiricahua Mountains, near Portal, Arizona, and work at the long-term field site about a 20-min drive from the station. Students will participate in observations and experiments. The field work will be most enjoyable for people who like to be outside and like to watch ants, and may lead to future research projects.  If you are interested please contact Prof D M Gordon, dmgordon@stanford.edu; lab website http://www.stanford.edu/~dmgordon/



## From Monolith to Mosaic
Contact: mlam4@stanford.edu

Faculty Supervisor: Michael Bernstein, James Landay

Short description: Amplifying Creative Divergence with Pluralistic AI

As large language models become ever more popular, worrisome patterns are emerging: what happens when models produce fluent but bland writing, or when they produce arguments that sound plausible but don’t align with our views? We’re trending towards a future of AI that allows users to efficiently carry out more tasks than ever—but only in the same way as everyone else. How could powerful modern AI systems not lead users to efficiently converge, but empower them to creatively diverge—to maintain and even amplify their unique voice?

In this project, we will be exploring how we can promote more divergent thinking through many pluralistic, specialized AI models rather than a monolithic, generic model. We will build interactive systems for everyday, non-technical users to create and orchestrate custom AI teams to amplify their creative vision. For example, a young writer could set up a team of their favorite short story authors and get their take on early story ideas; a researcher could build a team of professors trained in different experimental methods to review their paper draft; or student could assemble a team of foundational figures in psychology to debate about the student’s essay topic. We will explore the broad design space of methods for: instantiating and selecting AI team members, determining how these AI teams collaborate, and demonstrating novel interactions that can be unlocked once we have these dynamic, personalized teams of AI models. The project will develop both new interfaces and new algorithms—all in service of improving everyday users’ expressivity and sense of ownership over AI systems.

## Investigating the development of social cognition and learning
Contact: aneesacn@stanford.edu

Faculty Supervisor: Dr. Hyowon Gweon

Short description: Investigating the development of social cognition and learning

How do humans navigate the complex social world and learn from interacting with others? The Social Learning Lab (SLL) addresses these questions by using young children’s thinking and learning as a window into human cognition. Specific questions include: How do children reason about what others know? How do children learn about themselves, such as their own competence and abilities? Does disagreeing with others make young children more curious about the subject?  The lab uses a combination of behavioral and computational approaches, and interns will have the opportunity to interact directly with young children at Bing Nursery School or at our partner museum (JMZ). Some projects also involve online data collection (ChildrenHelpingScience) which requires programming skills (JavaScript, CSS). For more information about our research, please visit our website: sll.stanford.edu. 

Skills required: Ideal candidates will be reliable, highly motivated, and detail-oriented. Strong candidates will be comfortable interacting with families and children in person or over zoom, and have strong working knowledge of R, Python, JavaScript, CSS. Previous research  experience and/or working with children are not necessary but preferred. We also welcome candidates candidates with previous experience in crafts, product design, movie editing, 

Skills to be learned: The summer intern will be involved in many aspects of a scientific study, such as conception, study design, piloting, and data collection. The intern will also acquire valuable skills for  a career in science such as data analysis, stimuli design, presenting to scientific audiences, etc. 

For inquiries about the position, please email sociallearninglab@stanford.edu. 

## Mega-analysis of iterated reference games
Contact: veboyce@stanford.edu

Faculty Supervisor: Mike Frank

Short description: Process, visualize, and analyze language game datasets

The flexibility of language means that people can communicate about novel referents by re-purposing and extending words from their lexicons to coordinate on new expression -- meaning pairs. The formation of these ad-hoc linguistic conventions is commonly studied using iterated reference games where pairs or groups of participants repeatedly refer to novel referents in a matching game.
The current project seeks to aggregate data from a number of iterated reference game paradigms, to test hypotheses about how conventions are formed at larger scale and examine potential moderators. Main components of this project include harmonizing datasets into a standardized schema and preparing visualizations. We would be particularly excited to work on more NLP-oriented analyses, including the use of LLMs/VLMs to model semantics and semantic change, and to predict human responses. There will also be opportunities to run mega-analytic linear regression models.
A successful student will have interest in linguistics and communication, experience with data processing and visualization, and knowledge of a programming language such as R or python. Contact vboyce@stanford.edu with any questions.

## Augmented Reality for Creativity Support 
Contact: sfollmer@stanford.edu

Faculty Supervisor: Sean Follmer

Short description: Devising augmented reality experience to support everyday creativity

In this internship, interns will explore how augmented reality (AR) can enhance creativity in everyday context. AR overlays digital content onto the physical world, allowing objects to take on dynamic properties such as changing colors, lighting, and textures. This transformation can inspire new ways to perceive and reimagine our surroundings. This project specifically examines how such visual augmentation can shape creative use of objects. As part of this internship, interns will get involved in designing and developing augmented reality experiences and studying how users interact with AR-enhanced objects.

Interns responsibilities will include:
Conduct literature reviews to understand the existing research in AR technologies and creativity support tools. 
Contribute to designing and developing interactive AR prototypes and/or software applications. We will likely use tools such as Unity 3D and Python. Prior experience in those tools is encouraged but are not required.
Assist in planning and conducting human subjects studies to evaluate the proposed AR systems. Work closely with team members to analyze study data.
For any questions, feel free to contact yjtao@stanford.edu.


## Modeling how children learn to communicate with peers
Contact: rxdh@stanford.edu

Faculty Supervisor: Robert Hawkins

Short description: You'll help develop a modeling pipeline for understanding how children use language to communicate with each other.

While an extensive body of research has examined how children learn language from their caregivers, we know surprisingly little about how children adapt their communication when interacting with their peers. We are seeking a summer intern to work closely with postdocs and PhD students in the Social Interaction Lab to study children's language development across different social contexts. Specifically, this project aims to advance computational models of children's communicative development using a new multimodal (video and audio) dataset we have collected of naturalistic child-child conversations in preschool settings. The project will focus on understanding how children adapt their communication strategies across different social contexts through computational analysis of naturalistic conversations. 

The student will have the opportunity to work on one or more of the following research directions: (1) Developing and validating taxonomies of speech acts that capture how children communicate differently with peers versus caregivers, (2) Training computational models to automatically identify and classify these communicative acts in natural conversations, or (3) Aligning children's language use with the visual context to understand how they establish and maintain joint attention in different social settings.

This project offers excellent opportunities to develop skills in natural language processing, data visualization, and developmental psychology. Prior programming experience in Python or R is expected. There may be opportunities for publication or conference presentation based on the summer's work. Please contact Robert Hawkins (rdhawkins@stanford.edu) or Claire Bergey (cbergey@stanford.edu) for additional information. 


## SLL and VLL Internship: Using VR and Developmental Methods to Study Cognition
Contact: pgzhu@stanford.edu

Faculty Supervisor: Hyowon Gweon, Jiajun Wu

Short description: Use VR and Developmental Methods to study cognition

Reasoning about ourselves and our abilities is central to everyday life: it guides what challenges we choose to pursue, who we seek information from, and what strategies to take when faced with novel tasks. How do humans accomplish this? In this internship, interns will have the opportunity to use Virtual Reality (VR) methods to tackle these questions, focused on designing and executing cognitive science experiments to study human behavior in novel tasks. In addition, interns will also have the chance to carry out novel developmental experiments with young children at Bing Nursery School and local Bay Area children’s museums in order to investigate how this capacity emerges early in life. Together, these approaches aim to provide unified answers on how humans (both young and old) reason about their abilities and novel tasks.

Interns will have the opportunity to head one key project, but work on other projects as well. In addition, interns will engage in summer programming through the Social Learning Lab (reading groups, workshops, lab meetings, etc.). Prior experience in Python (for developing VR experiments) is preferred, as well as a willingness to work with young children (primarily 2- to 5-year-olds).

For questions, please reach out to Peter Zhu (pgzhu@stanford.edu).

## Does learning to read shape the functional organization of the frontal cortex?
Contact: jyeatman@stanford.edu

Faculty Supervisor: Jason Yeatman

Short description: Analysis of functional MRI data to examine how learning shapes brain organization

Children who struggle with reading (for example, with developmental dyslexia) often show abnormalities in brain activation in different brain regions. It remains unclear whether reading intervention can lead to short and long term changes in brain activation in the frontal cortex. In this project, you will learn to identify, label and quantify text-selective regions in the frontal cortex of children with dyslexia before and after they completed a reading intervention. This will help address the questions of 1) are there differences between the left and right hemisphere? 2) Can we identify compensatory mechanisms that support reading when the reading circuitry is altered? 3) How do these regions change over time and as children improve their reading skill?

Skills required:
Basic coding skills (desirable but not required), interest in cognitive development, detail-oriented

Skills to be learned:
Neuroanatomy of the reading circuitry, Freesurfer software, Combining anatomical and functional data, Statistical analysis with python

## Do children use emotion cues to help them learn?
Contact: bsparks@stanford.edu

Faculty Supervisor: Michael Frank

Short description: Designing a game to measure how children use emotions to learn

Young children experience and observe many different emotions over the course of a day. Children learn language in the context of this emotional backdrop. Do emotion cues, like facial expressions, body language, or tone of voice, help children learn new words? To answer this question, we’ll design a game where children will learn new words from a character that is displaying different emotions.

For questions, contact Dr. Mira Nencheva at miran@stanford.edu.
